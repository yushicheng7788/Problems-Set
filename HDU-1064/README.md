# Problem Description
Ignatius likes to write words in reverse way. Given a single line of text which is written by Ignatius, you should reverse all the words and then output them.

# Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line with several words. There will be at most 1000 characters in a line.

# Output
For each test case, you should output the text which is processed.

# Sample Input
3
olleh !dlrow
m'I morf .udh
I ekil .mca

# Sample Output
hello world!
I'm from hdu.
I like acm.

# Hint
Remember to use getchar() to read '\n' after the interger T, then you may use gets() to read a line and process it.

# Solution
Using stack.
